## About Project
Messages either received in the form of **Emails or SMS**, sometimes contain useful information or contain some information which is irrelevant, such as Advertisements, or information that may be used to dupe the recipient.<br>
Messages containing useful information are known as **HAM Messages**, whereas messages containing irrelevant information are known as **SPAM Messages**.<br>
The project aims to develop ML Models, that can be used detect whether a particular message is a **SPAM or HAM Message**.<br>
## Project Implementation
Two approaches were tried to detect messages,<br>
:one: Bag Of Words Model<br>
:two: Word Embeddings<br>
It was found that the **Word Embeddings Model** has a higher Accuracy & F1 Score.
## Libraries Used
The following libraries are used for the implementation of the project:<br>
:one: Tensorflow<br>
:two: Keras<br>
:three: Numpy<br>
:four: Pandas<br>
:five: Plotly<br>
:six: Matplotlib<br>
:seven: Pickle<br>
:eight: h5py<br>
:nine: Scikit-Learn
