## About Project
Messages either received in the form of **Emails or SMS**, sometimes contain useful information or contain some information which is irrelevant, such as Advertisements, or information that may be used to dupe the recipient.<br>
Messages containing useful information are known as **HAM Messages**, whereas messages containing irrelevant information are known as **SPAM Messages**.<br>
The project aims to develop ML Models, that can be used detect whether a particular message is a **SPAM or HAM Message**.<br>
## Project Implementation
Two approaches were tried to detect messages,
1. Bag Of Words Model
2. Word Embeddings<br>
It was found that the **Word Embeddings Model** has a higher Accuracy & F1 Score.
## Libraries Used
The following libraries are used for the implementation of the project:
1. Tensorflow
2. Keras
3. Numpy
4. Pandas
5. Plotly
6. Matplotlib
7. Pickle
8. h5py
9. Scikit-Learn
